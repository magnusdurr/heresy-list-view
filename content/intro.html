<h2>Epic Armageddon - Heresy</h2>

<p class="lead">
    Welcome to EA-Heresy. On these pages you will find fan based lists and scenarios for playing a 30k version of Epic Armageddon using Legions Imperialis models, that has been developed by the EA:Ragnarök team. Unlike our project for Epic Armageddon 40k, this version of the rules contains a number of significant <a href="content/rules.html">rules changes and additions</a>, as well as tweaks to <a href="content/rules.html">special rules</a>, which makes it a quite different experience to play. In many ways, these rules are for our version of Epic Armageddon 2nd Edition, and for this reason the armies and rules found here are not compatible with any lists designed for the current 40k version of the game. 
</p>
<p>
    For those that would like 30k rules that are more compatible with the standard version of the rules, there are plenty of great alternatives that have been released over the years, such as <a href="https://www.tacticalwargames.net/taccmd/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=34676" target="_blank" class="external">EpicAU</a> (not currently in development), or <a href="https://www.epicarmageddon.fr/epic-30k-horus-heresie/" target="_blank" class="external">F-ERC</a>, (in French) as well as efforts by the Epic-UK and NetEA communities (to be updated). In comparison to these previous projects EA-Heresy is aimed at both experienced EA players and those who come from Legions Imperialis and Adeptus Titanicus, and want to use their models in a new (and in our view, improved) version of the Epic Armageddon rules that is specifically designed for the 30k setting and the existing model range.

    These lists and he underlying changes to the rules are still in development, but we feel we have reached a point where they are ready for a public beta. We invite you to comment/bring ideas to the table through our <a href="https://discord.gg/J74rgpnXKg" target="_blank" class="external">EA:Ragnarök/EA-Heresy discord</a>. We play a lot of games online and invite you to also join in online games through the discord channel.

<h4>Rules Design</h4>

<p>
    While we were very happy that GW's 5:th edition of Epic (Legions Imperialis) re-introduces the 'Epic' scale at Games Workshop, we were somewhat mystified by their decision to go with a re-worked version of 2:nd edition epic for the rules, instead of using Epic 3:rd edition (Epic 40k) or 4:th edition (Epic Armageddon) as the foundation. As long-time Epic Armageddon players and rules developers, we immediately saw a need for a rule-set that not only provided rules for 30k armies in Epic Armageddon (as have already been noted, there are plenty of those!), but also use the Legions Imperialis model line as a foundation for the armies. Another important feature is the potential for a game that requires significantly fewer models than GW's LI, where decisions around rule design and army balance naturally always have to take into account monetary considerations.
</p>
<p>
   But the real driver behind this project has been that with the 30k setting being completely separate from the 40k version, there is no longer strictly necessary to keep things consistent and compatible with what has come before. This means that we would be free to re-make certain parts of the rules that we've always found to be lacking, in particular the rules for War Engines. The bigger Titans in particular have unfortunately become a rare sight in games of EA, and pure War Engine lists tend not be all that fun to play with or against. There would also be space to re-imagine the parts of the rules that deals with how offboard assets such as aircraft, drop pods, teleporters etc. enter the battlefield. 
</p>
<p>
   Another very important difference between EA-Heresy and other EA rules are the inclusion of 'Strongholds' in the game. These are strongly inspired by the 'Structures' in LI (and 'buildings' in Epic Space Marine). To keep things (relatively) simple, EA-Heresy Strongholds are perhaps best described as neutral transport War Engines that become Impassable terrain once destroyed. While turning terrain into gravel is undeniably cool, it creates the need to have twice as much terrain for each table. The complete rules for Strongholds can be found under the 'Terrain' tab. 
</p>


<h4>Army List Design</h4>
<p>
       
</p>
<p>
    At the core of our army list design philosophy for EA-Heresy is the idea that two basic boxes for LI should be able to produce at least two playable armies, the only thing that is really lacking is a box of Rhinos and some terrain to represent Strongholds. Unlike Legions Imperialis or Epic AU 30k lists, EA-Heresy lists will have much greater constraints on what a list may include. This is due to our focus on balanced armies with a mix of troop types, and that we want to create army lists that both have strenghts and interesting weaknesses. With so many Legions, it is very tempting to make a single list with everything to represent all legions, but that also makes the lists really unwieldy and lacking in personality. It also makes it hard to introduce alternative unit types, with alternative weaponry. That being said, there will eventually be a 'one with everything' list for those that prefer narrative play and want to use whatever collection of models they have in whatever chapter.   
</p>
<p>
    <b>New Points System:</b> One of the more radical departures from common list design has been the decision to experiment with Formation points (and Upgrade, Titan, and Ally points) when making lists, instead of the usual army points system. The intention behind this way of buying lists is to simplify army list building and enforce a strict balance in terms of activations. This also helps limit the tendency of EA lists to be only made up of basic formations without any upgrades, which in EA-Heresy is regulated by upgrade points.     
</p>
<p>
    <b>Xenos:</b> The 30k setting dictates that there will be a greater constraint on the number of factions than there is in the 40k setting. With the exception of Orks and Eldar, the Xenos are either absent or dormant in 30k, and since the game revolves around the Horus Heresy, even those Xenos that exist are very much pushed to the periphery. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Allies:</b> Inspired by the LI concept of Allies, all armies in EA-Heresy will be able to include some version of non-core armies. This access wont be as expansive as in LI though.
