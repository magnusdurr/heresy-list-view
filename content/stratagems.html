<h2>Stratagems</h2>
<p class="lead">
    This is a collection of all stratagems for all factions, intended to give an overview of what is available. Stratagems are picked at the start of each battle, after deployment has been carried out, but before the first strategy roll. You may pick one stratagem if your army contains any allied formations. If your army contains no allied formations, you may pick two stratagems. All stratagems should be kept secret until the point they are used.
