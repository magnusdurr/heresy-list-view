<h2>Rules</h2>
<p class="lead">
    EA - Heresy is based on the NetEA rules, which can be found over at the <a href="https://tp.net-armageddon.org/" target="_blank" class="external">NetEA Tournament Pack</a> site. However, we have also made a number of changes and additions to these rules, which can be found below under 'New Rules' headings. These new rules effectively makes EA - Heresy a different game from the core rules, and not particularly compatible with playing games against the 40k armies of e.g. NetEA, Epic UK, or EA:Ragnarök. For more information about this, see the 'About' page.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    In addition, there are a number of rules in the NetEA Epic Game Rules that can be interpreted in more than one way. Below the 'New Rules' are 'Rule interpretations & house-rules', that we have used when developing the EA - Heresy lists. We suggest you also use these when playing EA - Heresy games.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Strategy Phase</h4>
<h6>The Strategy Rating</h6>
<p>
    The Strategy rating is now between 3 to 1 (4 (Alpha Legion), 3 (Legiones Astartes), 2 (Solar Auxilia, 1 for Ruinstorm Cultists and Imperialis Militia). This number means the number of dice rolled when rolling to determine who goes first in a specific phase. In addition, the highest dice rolled will be modified by factors such as the number of allies, and who went first last turn, as seen in the table below.
</p>
<h6>Modifiers for Strategy Rolls</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Army is contains no allies: +1</li>
        <li>Army lost the strategy roll last turn: +1 </li>
        <li>Army has one allied faction: no modifier!</li>
        <li>Army has two allied factions: -1</li>
        <li>Army contains three allied factions: -2</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In case of ties, the army with the higher strategy rating always wins. The strategy modifiers are set at the start of battle, and does not change during the game even if all allied formations are destroyed.
</p>

<h4>New Rules - Actions</h4>
<h6>Overwatch</h6>
<p>
    Formations that successfully activates with an Overwatch order may also move 5 cm. This extra movement is voluntary (e.g. if a player wishes to avoid triggering enemy Overwatch).
</p>

<h6>Offboard Support</h6>
<p>
    Calling for Offboard Support is a new action that a player can take after having completed an Advance, Overwatch, Marshal, or Sustain Fire action with an unbroken formation that contains a unit with the Vox-Caster special rule. This counts as retaining the initiative, and thus cannot be done if the initiative has already been retained once. The Offboard Support action automatically succeeds.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified in the description of the Offboard Support asset, the following procedure is used. Place a marker within x cm (depending on the type of Offboard Support) within Line of Sight of the unit with the Vox-Caster special rule to indicate where the Offboard Support asset will come down. The Offboard Support is then carried out according to its special rules before the start of the next friendly action, or before the end phase, depending on which comes first.
</p>

Types of Offboard Support:

<h6>Teleport</h6>
<p>
    A formation consisting completely of units with the 'Teleport' special rule must be placed in the reserves before deployment. They may only enter the battlefield through an Offboard Support action. Immediately place the formation with all units completely within 15 cm of the unit with the 'Vox-Caster' special rule, and roll a D6 for each, to test if any teleport mishaps occured. For each roll of 1, the teleporting formation suffers a BM.
<p>
    Teleporting units placed within 15 cm of any enemy units with the 'Psyker' or 'Daemonic' special rules suffer Teleport Mishap for any 1 and 2 rolled, instead of just 1.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other Offboard Support actions, Teleporting grants immediately grants the controlling player the chance to retain the initiative twice, meaning that the formation that just arrived may attempt carry out an action.
</p>

<h6>Drop Pods</h6>
<p>
    A formation consisting completely of units of INF (without the 'Bulky', 'Jump Packs' or 'Mounted' special rules), and/or LV & AV with the 'Walker' special rules may be placed in Drop Pods. These must be placed in the reserves before deployment. They may only enter the battlefield through an Offboard Support action. Place the Drop Pod with its center within 15 cm of the unit with the 'Vox-Caster' special rule. Calling down a Drop Pod counts as an additional action, so the player using it may not retain the initiative afterwards.

    Once the Drop Pod arrives at the battlefield, move the Drop Pod marker up to 15 cm in any direction that does not place it in an enemy zone of control. Any enemy units within 10 cm of the centre of the drop pod are attacked by an AP6+/AT6+ (Disrupt) attack. After these attacks have been resolved, place the Drop Pods contents fully within 10 cm of the centre of the Drop Pod.
</p>
<h6>Dreadclaw</h6>
<p>
    A formation consisting completely of units of INF (without the 'Jump Packs' or 'Mounted' special rules), and/or LV & AV with the 'Walker' special rules may be placed in Dreadclaws. These must be placed in the reserves before deployment. They may only enter the battlefield through an Offboard Support action. Place the Dreadclaw with its center within 15 cm of the unit with the 'Vox-Caster' special rule. Calling down a Dreadclaw counts as an additional action, so the player using it may not retain the initiative afterwards.

    Once the Drop Pod arrives at the battlefield, move the Dreadclaw marker up to 15 cm in any direction that does not place it in an enemy zone of control. Then place the Dreadclaw contents fully within 10 cm of the centre of the Dreadclaw.
</p>
<h6>Deathwind</h6>
<p>
    A Deathwind attack places a marker within 15 cm of the model with 'Vox-Caster'. Once it arrives on the battlefield, it may be moved by 15 cm in any direction. Place the large barrage template with the centre hole over the marker. Any model under the template is attacked by a AP6+/AT6+ (Disrupt) attack.
</p>

<h6>Palisade Drop Pod</h6>
<p>
    A Palisade Drop Pod may only be used alongside other Drop Pods, and is added to a formation in Drop Pods or Dreadclaws during deployment. All models in the formation counts as being in Cover and gains the Invulnerable Save special rule for the purposes of Overwatch when they exit their Drop Pods.
</p>

<h6>Orbital Pin-Point Attack</h6>
<p>

</p>

<h6>Orbital Barrage</h6>
<p>
    An Orbital Barrage has a range of 45 cm. Once it arrives on the battlefield, place the small barrage template with its centre over the marker. Any unit under the template is attacked by an AP4+/AT5+ (MW) attack.
</p>
<h6>Heavy Artillery Strike</h6>
<p>
    A Heavy Barrage has a range of 60 cm. Once it arrives on the battlefield, place the large barrage template with its centre over the marker. Any unit under the template is attacked by an AP4+/AT6+ (Disrupt) attack.
</p>

    A Rad Barrage has a range of 45 cm. Once it arrives on the battlefield, place the large barrage template with its centre over the marker. Any unit under the template is attacked by an AP2+/AT6+ (Rad) attack.
</p>

<p>
    A Haywire Barrage has a range of 45 cm. Once it arrives on the battlefield, place the large barrage template with its centre over the marker. Any unit under the template is attacked by an AP6+/AT2+ (Rad) attack.
</p>

<h6>Minefield Submunitions Strike</h6>
<p>
    A Minefield Submunitions attack has a range of 15 cm. Unlike other Offboard Support assets, there is no delay for this attack to arrive. Place a Minefield template (same as a small barrage template) with its centre over the marker. No part of the template may be placed over any terrain or model. For the rest of the battle, this area is now considered to be dangerous terrain.
</p>

<h6>Blind Artillery Strike</h6>
<p>
    A Blind Burst has a range of 15 cm. Unlike other Offboard Support assets, there is no delay for this attack to arrive. Place the Blind template (same as a small barrage template) with its centre over the marker. No part of the template may be placed over any terrain (other than roads, water, or open ground) or on top of any model. For the rest of the battle, this area blocks line of sight and gives Cover just like terrain (it is in all other ways considered to be open ground, and does not give a cover save).
</p>

<h6>Deathstrike Attacks</h6>
<p>
    Unlike other Offboard Support assets Deathstrike missiles have unlimited range, but are reliant on more precise targeting data. This means that any marker put down on the battlefield needs to be confirmed by a second Offboard Support action by a unit with 'Vox-Caster' before the attack will commence. All markers that have not been confirmed expire at the end of each turn.
</p>

<h6>Deathstrike Warp Missile Attack</h6>

</p>
<p>
    Transitioning into becoming a Support Craft or Skimmer counts as movement for overwatch. An aircraft which transitions into a Support Craft may either shoot (with an additional -1 modifier to hit), or disembark any transported units.

    Each time a Support Craft suffers a BM for coming under fire, each transported formation also suffers one BM. This includes any BMs suffered during the approach move.
</p>


<h6>Aircraft Movement</h6>

    Aircraft no longer linger on the battlefield after carrying out ground attacks, interceptions, or CAP. Instead they immediately fly off after carrying out their action, and after any enemy formations have had a chance to carry out a CAP mission. Flying formations gain one BM for getting shot at while on the way in, and one on the way out as normal.

<h3>EA:Ragnarök - Heresy rule interpretations & house-rules</h3>
<h6>Say it and its true</h6>
<p>
    Effectively lots of things may move on a table. If a player is able to put a unit 6cm away from another unit, or 10cm into terrain, then saying they are doing so makes it so. This means if later a piece is budged say to cause intermingle, it won't be treated as such. - If you think it can't be done, advise your opponent when they 'say it'.
</p>

<h6>Contacting more than one enemy unit during an engage</h6>
<p>
    A gray zone in the rules is under what conditions a unit can touch more than one enemy unit when it engages. While units must move towards enemy units once they enter their zone of control is clear, but less clear is how creative with angling your models in the phase you can be. Our suggestion is to be liberal in interpreting this, and that
    engaging or counter charging units can always contact up to two enemy units if they have enough speed to do so, and there is enough physical space to fit.
</p>

<h6>When is a formation 'in a position to support'?</h6>
<p>
    After an Engage has been resolved, formations on the losing side recieves a Blast Marker, but it is not entirely clear exactly at which point during the Engage that this is determined. Our suggestion is that formations with units that has rolled FF dice (or could have been allowed to roll FF dice if they had an FF value or had not been broken), are considered to have been in a position to support. This resolves the situation in which units from the enemy formation were within 15cm from a formation at the start of the Engage, but were eliminated before the supporting formation had a chance to support.
</p>

<h6>Resolving hits from Supporting attacks</h6>
<p>
    In order to determine the direction and order of hits from supporting fire, such hits are resolved one supporting formation at a time, in any order that the controlling player wishes.
</p>

<h6>Preserve allocation order between normal and macro hits</h6>
<p>
    Macro and standard hits are resolved in separate phases of shooting and assaults. We suggest you preserve the
    allocation order between the two phases. I.e. Imperial Guard with a Gorgon assault and receive 2 normal hits and 1
    TK. The Gorgon and guardsmen are equally close to the enemy. If the Imperial Guard player choose to take the normal
    hits into the Gorgon, and it doesnt die, he must also take the TK into the Gorgon. Likewise if he take the regular
    hits into the guardsmen and they dont die the TK goes into the guardsmen. If the Guardsmen die from the normal hits
    the TK goes into the nearest surviving unit to the enemy.
</p>

<h6>Formations mixing BP and standard weapons</h6>
<p>
    As far as we understand there are no rules defining how things work when a formation fires both BP and standard
    weapons. We suggest the following house-rule: A formation can chose to fire it's BP weapons before or after any
    non-BP weapons has been fired. This includes Macro and Titan Killer BP weapons (an exception to the
    macro-always-goes-last rule). Resolve the BP shooting as a separate phase i.e. allocate and resolve hits from the BP
    weapon
    before moving on to ordinary weapons. Hits from ordinary weapons should be allocated front-to-back, as usual. This
    means that units that were hit by the BP weapon and survived can be allocated a second hit from standard
    shooting.
</p>

<h6>Maximize the effect of special rules when shooting</h6>
<p>
    There are cases where some of the weapons fired has special rules while others don't. It could be Tau Railgun
    Hammerheads (where some of the AT fire has <i>Lance</i>) or a Baneblade where one of the weapons has <i>
        Ignore
        Cover
    </i>. Hits are (as always) allocated from the front to the back but if it matters how the hits with special
    rules are allocated, if should be done to favor of the shooting formation. E.g. A Baneblade fires at orks, where
    three orks are in the open while the rest is in a house (4+ cover save). The Baneblade fires all its weapons into
    cover (to be able to hit all the Orks). It scores four AP hits without special rules and one with the <i>
        ignore
        cover
    </i> special rule. In this case the <i>ignore cover</i> hit should not be allocated to any of the three Orks
    hit in the open but to one of the two Orks in the house to maximize the effect of <i>ignore cover</i>. Another
    example would be the Hammerheads shooting at a Chaos Armoured Company of two Predators and two Land Raiders. The
    Hammerheads score one standard hit and two with <i>lance</i>. The Predators are in front of the Chaos formation and
    will take the two first hits. The remaining hit, allocated to the Land Raider, should be one of the two hits with
    <i>lance</i>.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking ground transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from a transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm of the transport. Only a part
    of the model needs to be within 5cm of the transport vehicle, not the whole model. When embarking on a ground
    transport the transport needs to touch the unit it is picking up.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking air transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from an air transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm (or 15cm if the unit has
    <i>jump packs</i>) of the transport. Only a part of the model needs to be within 5cm (or 15cm) of the transport
    vehicle, not the whole model. When an air transport lands to pick up a formation, all units within (any part of the
    model) 5cm of the transport can be picked up. The air transport can land on (barge) the units it is picking up. This
    way you don't have to prepare a free "landing zone" inside a large formation in order to get all units in the
    formation in range to be picked up. A formation may also move on to a landed air transport, in which case all units
    needs to touch the landed air transport in order to embark (no 5cm "pickup zone" in this case)
</p>

<h6>Barging with transport aircraft</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not explicitly allow or disallow transport aircraft from barging, but does state that barging is made as part of movement.
    But as aircraft landing or taking off is not considered movement for Overwatch purposes, it seems most consistent to not allow transport
    aircraft to barge.
</p>

<h6>Broken air transports</h6>
<p>
    In case an air transport breaks (without dying) it can choose to stay on the board and rally like any other
    ground unit or to make a disengagement move. The rules for what happens if it chooses to fly off is a bit
    vague. We suggest the following: As soon as the unit/formation takes of in order to fly out it once again
    counts as an aircraft, with a number of blast markers equal to the number it took to break the unit or
    formation. It can (like any other aircraft) pick up additional blastmarkes on the way out, if shot by enemy
    flak and/or if it exits from any table edge other than its own table edge.
    E.g. an Ork Landa is broken by shooting on the ground and choses to fly off in the end phase. Once airborn
    it will have 3 blast markers (one for each DC). It is also hit by enemy flak (without being wounded) on the
    way out, resulting in 4 BMs when trying to activate in the next turn.
</p>

<h6>Aircraft sniping</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not restrict you from placing ground attacking aircrafts inside a formation or even on top of
    enemy units in order to allocate hits to chosen enemy characters or units. This feels a bit gamy, and we
    suggest the following house-rule: Aircrafts on a ground attack mission may not be placed within 5cm of an
    enemy unit in the formation it is targeting. The restriction is always 5cm even for units with the
    <i>Scout</i> special rule.
</p>

<h6>Always roll for critical hits</h6>
<p>
    Players must always roll for critical hits in any situation where the critical hit may affect units or formations
    around the war engine,
    even if the War Engine was reduced to 0 DC before crits have been rolled for.
</p>

<h6>Terrain height, skimmers & hills</h6>
<p>
    Terrain and War Engines are "infinitely high" to ground units with regards to line of sight. No ground unit can see
    directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over terrain, but can only
    see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule as for popped up
    skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain. In addition, see the 'Terrain'
    section on this website.
</p>
<h6>Skimmers, terrain and movement</h6>
<p>
    Skimmers only checks for dangerous and difficult terrain at the start and at the end of their total movement, unless otherwise stated by the player.
    Skimmers that ignore intervening terrain can obviously not claim cover from such terrain, and counts as being popped up for Overwatch purposes.
