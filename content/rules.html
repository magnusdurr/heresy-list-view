<h2>Rules</h2>
<p class="lead">
    EA - Heresy is based on the NetEA rules, which can be found over at the <a href="http://www.tp.net-armageddon.org/tournament-pack/" target="_blank" class="external">NetEA Tournament Pack</a> site. However, we have also made a number of changes and additions to these rules, which can be found below under 'New Rules' headings. These new rules effectively makes EA - Heresy a different game from the core rules, and not particularly compatible with playing games against the 40k armies of e.g. NetEA, Epic UK, or EA:Ragnarök. For more information about this, see the 'About' page.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    In addition, there are a number of rules in the NetEA Epic Game Rules that can be interpreted in more than one way. Below the 'New Rules' are 'Rule interpretations & house-rules', that we have used when developing the EA - Heresy lists. We suggest you also use these when playing EA - Heresy games.
</p>

<h4>New Rules - Actions</h4>
<h6>Overwatch</h6>
<p>
    Formations that successfully activates with an Overwatch order may also move 5 cm. This extra movement is voluntary (e.g. if a player wishes to avoid triggering enemy Overwatch).
</p>

<h6>Offboard Support</h6>
<p>
    Calling for Offboard Support is a new action that a player can take after having completed an Advance, Overwatch, Marshal, or Sustain Fire action with an unbroken formation that contains a unit with the Commander special rule. This counts as retaining the initiative, and thus cannot be done if the initiative has already been retained once. The Offboard Support action automatically succeeds.
</p>
<p>
    Place a marker within 15-45 cm (depending on the type of Offboard Support) of the unit with the Commander special rule to indicate where the Offboard Support asset will come down. The Offboard Support is then carried out according to its special rules before the start of the next friendly action, or before the end phase, depending on which comes first.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Movement</h4>

<h6>Movement through friendly formations</h6>
<p>
    INF may move freely through all types of units, and can be moved through freely.
</p>

<h6>Movement through enemy formations</h6>
<p>
    Units may move past enemy formations when becoming broken or failing to rally while broken. This bonus movement ignores enemy zones of control, and may move over enemy units.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Assaults</h4>

<h6>Countercharges</h6>
<p>
    Units in formations that are Engaged may choose whether to counter-charge against the closest enemy unit in the formation that Engaged it, and may ignore already Engaged enemy models while doing so, or alternatively counter-charge against the closest enemy unit.
</p>
<p>
    Units in formations that become Engaged do not have to stay in coherency while counter-charging, but must attempt to move back into coherency when the Assault is over.
</p>

<h6>Supporting Formations</h6>
<p>
    Units do not ignore BMs when supporting an Assault, but are suppressed just like with Shooting (from back to front).
</p>

<h6>New Combat Resolution Modifier Table (Cumulative)</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each point of damage inflicted during the Assault: +1</li>
        <li>More units than the opposing formation: +1</li>
        <li>More than two times as many units as the opposing formation: +1</li>
        <li>No Blast Markers: +1</li>
        <li>Opponent has more Blast Markers: +1</li>
        <li>Opponent has more Blast Markers than their combined number of units / DC, or is broken: +1</li>
        <li>Opponent has at least one unit inside a Stronghold that has become Wrecked during the Assault: +1</li>
        <li>Each successful Psyker roll (including supporting units): +1</li>
        <li>Each unit with the Inspiring special rule: +1</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>New Rules - War Engines</h4>

<h6>War Engine Basic Rules</h6>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>WE no longer block LOS.</li>
        <li>WE may allocate CC hits beyond base contact.</li>
        <li>WE may not barge.</li>
        <li>WE must allocate at least one dice to CC for each unit / DC in base contact during an assault. </li>
        <li>WE CC attacks allocated towards INF suffer -1 to hit.</li>
        <li>WE CC attacks allocated against other War Engines gain an additional +1 to hit.</li>
        <li>Aircraft and BP type weapons gain an additional +1 to hit War Engines with less than 3 DC, and +2 to hit against WE with 3 or more DC. </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h6>Void Shields</h6>
<p>
    Each Void Shield on an unbroken formation causes one BM when it goes down. Void Shields on broken formations do not cause BMs. Void Shields still does not count as kills during an Engage.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Blast Markers, Breaking, Rallying</h4>
<p>
    Formations only become broken after exceeding the number of units, not equalling them. This means that a formation can become completely suppressed without becoming broken.
</p>
<p>
    Formations that attempt to rally suffer an additional -1 penalty if it is completely on the enemy half of the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
    Only unbroken enemy units count for the “enemies within 30 cm” check.
</p>
<p>
    Formations that are completely inside a War Engine transport or Stronghold gains an additional +1 to rally.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Aircraft</h4>

<h6>Hover</h6>
<p>
    In addition to the Fighter, Fighter-Bomber, and Bomber types of AC, there is now also the Hover type. Aircraft with Hover are treated as AC with Bomber during their first approach to the battlefield. Once at the final location, they transition into becoming Support Craft (for WE) or Skimmers (for AV) for the rest of the battle.
</p>
<p>
    Transitioning into becoming a Support Craft or Skimmer counts as movement for overwatch. An aircraft which transitions into a Support Craft counts as having made a March action the turn it arrives. Disembarking from an Aircraft that is transitioning into a Support Craft do not count as an activation.
</p>

<h6>Support Craft</h6>
<p>
    Support Craft may only contest objectives.
</p>

<h6>Support Craft Transports</h6>
<p>
    Support Craft may pick up friendly formations on the battlefield by ending its movement close to or on top of the formation(s) that are to be picked up. If all units in that formation(s) are within 5 cm of the Support Craft, they may be picked up. Any units in the formation that cannot fit are destroyed, causing a BM on that formation.
</p>
<p>
    Units with Jump Pack or Skimmer may disembark up to 15 cm away from Support Crafts, instead of the usual 5 cm.
</p>
<p>
    Support Craft may embark and disembark formations that have already activated this round, including broken formations.
</p>
<p>
    Each time a Support Craft suffers a BM for coming under fire, each transported formation also suffers one BM. This includes any BMs suffered during the approach move.
</p>


<h6>Aircraft Movement</h6>
<p>
    Aircraft no longer linger on the battlefield after carrying out ground attacks, interceptions, or CAP. Instead they immediately fly off after any enemy formations have had a chance to carry out a CAP mission. Flying formations gain one BM for getting shot at while on the way in, and one on the way out as normal.
</p>

<h6>Aircraft CAP</h6>
<p>
    Formations of Fighter and Fighter-Bomber AC may start the game on CAP. This counts as their action for the first turn.
</p>

<h6>Shooting at WE</h6>
<p>
    Aircraft gain an additional +1 modifier when shooting at WE with 1-2 DC, and +2 when shooting at WE with 3 or more DC.
</p>


<h4>New Rules - Weapon Special Rules</h4>

<h6>Macro-Weapon</h6>
<p>
    The MW special rule ignores armour as normal, but in EA - Heresy such weapons will always have their weapon profile split into AP/AT/AA parts.
</p>

<h4>New Rules - Unit Special Rules</h4>

<h6>Skirmisher</h6>
<p>
    Units with the 'Skirmisher' special rule is in coherency if they are within 10 cm from another unit instead of the usual 5 cm. Units with 'Skirmisher' may garrison according to the same rules as units with 'Scout'.
</p>
<h6>Blitz</h6>
<p>
    Units with the 'Blitz' special rule gains an additional 5 cm in speed when conducting an Engage action.
</p>
<h6>Tall</h6>
<p>

</p>
<h6>Bulky</h6>
<p>

</p>
<h6>Commander (x)</h6>
<p>

</p>

<h4>New Rules - Terrain</h4>
<h5>Strongholds</h5>
<p>
    Strongholds are a new type of terrain representing large buildings and fortifications that is an essential part of EA - Heresy, in practice a type of neutral WE transport that can be occupied by either side. While it is certainly possible to play without them, this will affect game balance as certain types of units are assumed to benefit from them or to counter them. For this reason, it is the only type of terrain that is compulsory in the main game scenario.
</p>

<h6>Stronghold Stats</h6>
<p>
    Strongholds are basically a type of immobile War Engine, and come in three sizes; small (3 DC), medium (4 DC) and large (5 DC). They have 5+ Armour Save, and counts as having Reinforced Armour and Thick Rear Armour. Critical hits on a Stronghold causes one additional point of damage.
</p>

<h6>Occupying Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    For each starting DC, the Stronghold can be occupied by two INF, one INF with the 'Bulky' or 'Mounted' special rules, or one AV or LV with the 'Walker' special rule. Once a unit enters a Stronghold it must stop, and may not move any further. As with a transport WE, there is no need to keep track of where inside a Stronghold each unit is, or on which floor they are. Once there is a unit inside, the Stronghold counts as being part of the occupying army, and may not be entered by the opposing side.
</p>
<p>
    Some Strongholds have flat roofs which makes it possible to store occupying units there. But since many do not, it is recommended to use counters next to occupied Strongholds to mark which side is occupying them, placing the 'transported' units next to the battlefield. Blast Markers and Order Tokens/Dice should be stored next to the Stronghold.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Line of Sight</h6>
<p>
    Unlike WE, Strongholds blocks line of sight in the same way that any other terrain does. Certain Strongholds may also count as being 'Tall', in which case they also block line of sight to e.g. units on hills, Support Craft, or certain Titans.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Blast Markers</h6>
<p>
    When a formation occupies a Stronghold, it becomes part of the formation, and increases their formation size accordingly. This also means that any damage, or e.g. hits with the Disrupt special rule, caused on the Stronghold will cause BMs to accumulate on the occupying formation(s). If there is more than one formation inside, the occupying player may choose how to divide the BMs caused.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Shooting</h6>
<p>
    Units inside a Stronghold can shoot as normal, and can do so from any part of the Stronghold. When shooting at a Stronghold, units inside cannot be hit directly, but can only be affected when the Stronghold they are in goes down to 0 DC and is 'Wrecked' (see below). Strongholds are affected by shooting like any other WE, but in addition weapons with the Ignore Cover or BP type weapons (that uses templates) may use AP instead of AT when rolling to hit.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Assaults</h6>
<p>
    As with Shooting, all attacks during an assault is directed against the Stronghold and not the units inside. Units inside may only use their FF stats, and must be moved outside of the Stronghold (for example with a Countercharge move) if they want to use their CC stats. If the Stronghold goes down to 0 DC during the Assault it is 'Wrecked' (see below).
</p>
<h6>Wrecking Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    Once a Stronghold goes down to 0 DC, it counts as being Wrecked, and will be considered Impassable Terrain for the rest of the game. Any formation with at least one unit inside a Wrecked Stronghold suffers a BM and all units inside takes a hit (with all damage counted towards Combat Resolution). Any surviving units are forced to exit the building after the current action has been resolved. Any formation with at least one unit inside a Wrecked Stronghold loses their chance to activate this turn if they have not already done so. If the formation is on Overwatch, they instead count as having taken an 'Hold' action.
</p>


<h3>EA:Ragnarök - Heresy rule interpretations & house-rules</h3>
<h6>Say it and its true</h6>
<p>
    Effectively lots of things may move on a table. If a player is able to put a unit 6cm away from another unit, or 10cm into terrain, then saying they are doing so makes it so. This means if later a piece is budged say to cause intermingle, it won't be treated as such. - If you think it can't be done, advise your opponent when they 'say it'.
</p>

<h6>Contacting more than one enemy unit during an engage</h6>
<p>
    A gray zone in the rules is under what conditions a unit can touch more than one enemy unit when it engages. While units must move towards enemy units once they enter their zone of control is clear, but less clear is how creative with angling your models in the phase you can be. Our suggestion is to be liberal in interpreting this, and that
    engaging or counter charging units can always contact up to two enemy units if they have enough speed to do so, and there is enough physical space to fit.
</p>

<h6>When is a formation 'in a position to support'?</h6>
<p>
    After an Engage has been resolved, formations on the losing side recieves a Blast Marker, but it is not entirely clear exactly at which point during the Engage that this is determined. Our suggestion is that formations with units that has rolled FF dice (or could have been allowed to roll FF dice if they had an FF value or had not been broken), are considered to have been in a position to support. This resolves the situation in which units from the enemy formation were within 15cm from a formation at the start of the Engage, but were eliminated before the supporting formation had a chance to support.
</p>

<h6>Resolving hits from Supporting attacks</h6>
<p>
    In order to determine the direction and order of hits from supporting fire, such hits are resolved one supporting formation at a time, in any order that the controlling player wishes.
</p>

<h6>Preserve allocation order between normal and macro hits</h6>
<p>
    Macro and standard hits are resolved in separate phases of shooting and assaults. We suggest you preserve the
    allocation order between the two phases. I.e. Imperial Guard with a Gorgon assault and receive 2 normal hits and 1
    TK. The Gorgon and guardsmen are equally close to the enemy. If the Imperial Guard player choose to take the normal
    hits into the Gorgon, and it doesnt die, he must also take the TK into the Gorgon. Likewise if he take the regular
    hits into the guardsmen and they dont die the TK goes into the guardsmen. If the Guardsmen die from the normal hits
    the TK goes into the nearest surviving unit to the enemy.
</p>

<h6>Formations mixing BP and standard weapons</h6>
<p>
    As far as we understand there are no rules defining how things work when a formation fires both BP and standard
    weapons. We suggest the following house-rule: A formation can chose to fire it's BP weapons before or after any
    non-BP weapons has been fired. This includes Macro and Titan Killer BP weapons (an exception to the
    macro-always-goes-last rule). Resolve the BP shooting as a separate phase i.e. allocate and resolve hits from the BP
    weapon
    before moving on to ordinary weapons. Hits from ordinary weapons should be allocated front-to-back, as usual. This
    means that units that were hit by the BP weapon and survived can be allocated a second hit from standard
    shooting.
</p>

<h6>Maximize the effect of special rules when shooting</h6>
<p>
    There are cases where some of the weapons fired has special rules while others don't. It could be Tau Railgun
    Hammerheads (where some of the AT fire has <i>Lance</i>) or a Baneblade where one of the weapons has <i>
        Ignore
        Cover
    </i>. Hits are (as always) allocated from the front to the back but if it matters how the hits with special
    rules are allocated, if should be done to favor of the shooting formation. E.g. A Baneblade fires at orks, where
    three orks are in the open while the rest is in a house (4+ cover save). The Baneblade fires all its weapons into
    cover (to be able to hit all the Orks). It scores four AP hits without special rules and one with the <i>
        ignore
        cover
    </i> special rule. In this case the <i>ignore cover</i> hit should not be allocated to any of the three Orks
    hit in the open but to one of the two Orks in the house to maximize the effect of <i>ignore cover</i>. Another
    example would be the Hammerheads shooting at a Chaos Armoured Company of two Predators and two Land Raiders. The
    Hammerheads score one standard hit and two with <i>lance</i>. The Predators are in front of the Chaos formation and
    will take the two first hits. The remaining hit, allocated to the Land Raider, should be one of the two hits with
    <i>lance</i>.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking ground transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from a transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm of the transport. Only a part
    of the model needs to be within 5cm of the transport vehicle, not the whole model. When embarking on a ground
    transport the transport needs to touch the unit it is picking up.
</p>

<h6>Disembarking & embarking air transports</h6>
<p>
    When disembarking from an air transport the disembarking unit should be placed within 5cm (or 15cm if the unit has
    <i>jump packs</i>) of the transport. Only a part of the model needs to be within 5cm (or 15cm) of the transport
    vehicle, not the whole model. When an air transport lands to pick up a formation, all units within (any part of the
    model) 5cm of the transport can be picked up. The air transport can land on (barge) the units it is picking up. This
    way you don't have to prepare a free "landing zone" inside a large formation in order to get all units in the
    formation in range to be picked up. A formation may also move on to a landed air transport, in which case all units
    needs to touch the landed air transport in order to embark (no 5cm "pickup zone" in this case)
</p>

<h6>Barging with transport aircraft</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not explicitly allow or disallow transport aircraft from barging, but does state that barging is made as part of movement.
    But as aircraft landing or taking off is not considered movement for Overwatch purposes, it seems most consistent to not allow transport
    aircraft to barge.
</p>

<h6>Broken air transports</h6>
<p>
    In case an air transport breaks (without dying) it can choose to stay on the board and rally like any other
    ground unit or to make a disengagement move. The rules for what happens if it chooses to fly off is a bit
    vague. We suggest the following: As soon as the unit/formation takes of in order to fly out it once again
    counts as an aircraft, with a number of blast markers equal to the number it took to break the unit or
    formation. It can (like any other aircraft) pick up additional blastmarkes on the way out, if shot by enemy
    flak and/or if it exits from any table edge other than its own table edge.
    E.g. an Ork Landa is broken by shooting on the ground and choses to fly off in the end phase. Once airborn
    it will have 3 blast markers (one for each DC). It is also hit by enemy flak (without being wounded) on the
    way out, resulting in 4 BMs when trying to activate in the next turn.
</p>

<h6>Aircraft sniping</h6>
<p>
    The rules does not restrict you from placing ground attacking aircrafts inside a formation or even on top of
    enemy units in order to allocate hits to chosen enemy characters or units. This feels a bit gamy, and we
    suggest the following house-rule: Aircrafts on a ground attack mission may not be placed within 5cm of an
    enemy unit in the formation it is targeting. The restriction is always 5cm even for units with the
    <i>Scout</i> special rule.
</p>

<h6>Always roll for critical hits</h6>
<p>
    Players must always roll for critical hits in any situation where the critical hit may affect units or formations
    around the war engine,
    even if the War Engine was reduced to 0 DC before crits have been rolled for.
</p>

<h6>Terrain height, skimmers & hills</h6>
<p>
    Terrain and War Engines are "infinitely high" to ground units with regards to line of sight. No ground unit can see
    directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over terrain, but can only
    see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule as for popped up
    skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain. In addition, see the 'Terrain'
    section on this website.
</p>
<h6>Skimmers, terrain and movement</h6>
<p>
    Skimmers only checks for dangerous and difficult terrain at the start and at the end of their total movement, unless otherwise stated by the player.
    Skimmers that ignore intervening terrain can obviously not claim cover from such terrain, and counts as being popped up for Overwatch purposes.
</p>
