<h2>Terrain</h2>

<p class="lead">
    In EA - Heresy, games tend to occur in urban areas or around fortifications. One essential part of this is more detailed rules for intact buildings, which in EA - Heresy are termed Strongholds. They replace the Large Building category in EA:Ragnarök.  
</p>

<h4>Strongholds</h4>
<p>
    Strongholds are a new type of terrain representing large buildings and fortifications that is an essential part of EA - Heresy, in practice a type of neutral WE transport that can be occupied by either side. While it is certainly possible to play without them, this will affect game balance as certain types of units are assumed to benefit from them or to counter them. For this reason, it is the only type of terrain that is compulsory in the main game scenario.
</p>

<h6>Stronghold Stats</h6>
<p>
    Strongholds are basically a type of immobile War Engine, and come in three sizes; small (3 DC), medium (4 DC) and large (5 DC). They have 5+ Armour Save, and counts as having Reinforced Armour and Thick Rear Armour. Critical hits on a Stronghold cause one additional point of damage.
</p>

<h6>Occupying Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    For each starting DC, the Stronghold can be occupied by two INF, one INF with the 'Bulky' or 'Mounted' special rules, or one AV or LV with the 'Walker' special rule. Once a unit enters a Stronghold it must stop, and may not move any further. As with a transport WE, there is no need to keep track of where inside a Stronghold each unit is, or on which floor they are. Once there is a unit inside, the Stronghold counts as being part of the occupying army, and may not be entered by the opposing side.
</p>
<p>
    Some Strongholds have flat roofs which makes it possible to store occupying units there. But since many do not, it is recommended to use counters next to occupied Strongholds to mark which side is occupying them, placing the 'transported' units next to the battlefield. Blast Markers and Order Tokens/Dice should be stored next to the Stronghold.
</p>

<h6>Strongholds and Line of Sight</h6>
<p>
    Unlike WE, Strongholds blocks line of sight in the same way that any other terrain does. Certain Strongholds may also count as being 'Tall', in which case they also block line of sight to e.g. units on hills, Support Craft, or certain Titans.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Blast Markers</h6>
<p>
    When a formation occupies a Stronghold, it becomes part of the formation, and increases their formation size accordingly. This also means that any damage, or e.g. hits with the Disrupt special rule, caused on the Stronghold will cause BMs to accumulate on the occupying formation(s). If there is more than one formation inside, the occupying player may choose how to divide the BMs caused.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Shooting</h6>
<p>
    Units inside a Stronghold can shoot as normal, and can do so from any part of the Stronghold. When shooting at a Stronghold, units inside cannot be hit directly, but can only be affected when the Stronghold they are in goes down to 0 DC and is 'Wrecked' (see below). Strongholds are affected by shooting like any other WE, but in addition weapons with the Ignore Cover or BP type weapons (that uses templates) may use AP instead of AT when rolling to hit.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Assaults</h6>
<p>
    As with Shooting, all attacks during an assault is directed against the Stronghold and not the units inside. Units inside may only use their FF stats, and must be moved outside of the Stronghold (for example with a Countercharge move) if they want to use their CC stats. If the Stronghold goes down to 0 DC during the Assault it is 'Wrecked' (see below).
</p>
<p>
    Strongholds only count for Outnumber in an Assault if there is at least one unit inside that is participating in the combat.
</p>
<h6>Wrecking Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    Once a Stronghold goes down to 0 DC, it counts as being Wrecked, and will be considered Impassable Terrain for the rest of the game. Any formation with at least one unit inside a Wrecked Stronghold suffers a BM and all units inside takes a hit with a +1 armour save modifier (with all damage counted towards Combat Resolution). Any surviving units are forced to exit the building after the current action has been resolved. Any formation with at least one unit inside a Wrecked Stronghold loses their chance to activate this turn if they have not already done so. If the formation is on Overwatch, they instead count as having taken an 'Hold' action.
</p>

<h4>True line of sight vs. infinite height</h4>

<p>
    Epic Armageddon rules as written assumes you play with "true line of sight", meaning if the Warlord model is taller
    than the wood, you can see it from the other side. The leads to various odd scenarios (such as people modelling
    their Warhounds kneeling, to be able to hide behind low terrain) and discussions. We strongly recommend you play
    all terrain as "infinitely high". This also includes War Engines, as they also block Line of Sight.
</p>
<p>
    No ground unit can see directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers can see over
    terrain, but can only see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule
    as for popped up skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircrafts can always see over all terrain.
</p>

<h4>Terrain Effects</h4>
<p>
    We have revised a few of the terrain effects from the NetEA rules. Terrain effects not mentioned here are identical
    to the NetEA rules.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Difficult terrain</b>:
    In addition to the standard Dangerous terrain we have introduced Difficult terrain.

    Roll a D6 when you enter difficult terrain, or when you start to move if already in difficult terrain. On a roll of
    1 you roll a second die. On a roll of 1-3 on the second die, the unit takes a hit with no save allowed, but the
    formation it is part of does not receive a Blast marker.

    Units may choose to move through difficult terrain cautiously. Such a unit counts as having a
    speed of 5cm, but does not have to roll any Difficult Terrain test. Units with the <i>Walker</i> special rule may
    move through Difficult terrain without rolling Difficult terrain tests.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Ground</b>:
    In the Core rules it is mentioned as a terrain effect on open ground that Infantry count as being in cover (-1 to
    hit modifier) and receive a 5+ cover save if they are on <i>Overwatch</i> in Open Ground. We suggest you extend
    this rule to all terrain types. I.e. an Infantry unit on <i>Overwatch</i> in Scrubs (6+ cover save) would still
    get 5+ cover save from being on <i>Overwatch</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hills</b>: As previously mentioned, units on a hill counts as popped up skimmers for the purpose of Line of
    Sight (see the top section of this page). Hills may optionally have one or more steep hillsides, which are
    impassable to all unit types (make sure to cover this during the five minute warm up).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Roads</b>: Units that spend a whole move on a road may add 5cms to their move (does not apply to non-standard
    movement such as counter charges or consolidation movement). In addition, if all units in the formation are on
    a road at the start of their action, you may declare they will make a road move. If the formation selects an
    Advance, Double or March action they get +1 to the activation roll. However, all the units in the formation must
    remain on the road during the entire action.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Armoured Vehicles</b>:
    Infantry units counts as being in cover and receive the -1 to hit modifier (but no cover save) if they are touching
    a <b>friendly</b> Armoured Vehicle or War Engine, to represent their ability to take cover from enemy fire by
    crouching behind the vehicle. There can be no more than two units for each Armoured Vehicle, or
    two for each DC that a War Engine has.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hull Down</b>: All terrain that blocks Line of Sight can give Hull Down to units that are inside such terrain, or
    that is even partially obscured behind it, to all units in the firing formation.
