<h2>Terrain</h2>

<p class="lead">
    In EA - Heresy, games tend to occur in urban areas or around fortifications. One essential part of this is more detailed rules for intact buildings, which in EA - Heresy are termed Strongholds. They replace the Large Building category in EA:Ragnarök.  
</p>

<h4>Strongholds</h4>
<p>
    Strongholds are a new type of terrain representing large buildings and fortifications that is an essential part of EA - Heresy, in practice a type of neutral WE transport that can be occupied by either side. While it is certainly possible to play without them, this will affect game balance as certain types of units are assumed to benefit from them or to counter them. For this reason, it is the only type of terrain that is compulsory in the main game scenario.
</p>

<h6>Stronghold Stats</h6>
<p>
    Strongholds are basically a type of immobile War Engine, and come in three sizes; Small (4 DC), Medium (5 DC) and Large (6 DC). They have 5+ Armour Save, and counts as having Reinforced Armour and Thick Rear Armour. Large Strongholds also have the Towering special rule. Critical hits on a Stronghold cause one additional point of damage.
</p>

<h6>Occupying Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    For each starting DC, the Stronghold can be occupied by two INF, one INF with the 'Bulky' or 'Mounted' special rules, or one AV or LV with the 'Walker' special rule. Once a unit enters a Stronghold it must stop, and may not move any further. As with a transport WE, there is no need to keep track of where inside a Stronghold each unit is, or on which floor they are. Once there is a unit inside, the Stronghold counts as being part of the occupying army, and may only be entered by the opposing side during an Engage (see section below).
</p>
<p>
    Some Strongholds have flat roofs which makes it possible to store occupying units there. But since many do not, it is recommended to use counters next to occupied Strongholds to mark which side is occupying them, placing the 'transported' units next to the battlefield. Blast Markers and Order Tokens/Dice should be stored next to the Stronghold.
</p>
<h6>Occupying Strongholds in enemy Zone of Control</h6>
<p>
    If a Stronghold is within an enemy Zone of Control, but there is no enemy unit inside, it is still possible to enter and occupy that Stronghold. This means that it is possible for units to be within each other's ZoC temporarily. Units inside the Stronghold are unaffected by this, and may still shoot as normal. The unit outside is affected as normal, and must either Engage the Stronghold or move away when it is their turn to act. 
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Line of Sight</h6>
<p>
    Unlike WE, Strongholds blocks line of sight in the same way that any other terrain does. Certain Strongholds may also count as being 'Towering'.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Blast Markers</h6>
<p>
    When a formation occupies a Stronghold, it becomes part of the formation, but does not increase their formation size for the purposes of Blast Markers. Any damage, or e.g. hits with the Disrupt special rule, caused on the Stronghold will cause BMs to accumulate on the occupying formation(s). If there is more than one formation inside, these are divided evenly between formations, so that no formation has more than any other. In case of ties, the larger formations gain blast markers first.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Shooting</h6>
<p>
    Units inside a Stronghold can shoot as normal, and can do so from any part of the Stronghold. When shooting at a Stronghold, units inside cannot be hit directly, but can only be affected when the Stronghold they are in goes down to 0 DC and is 'Ruined' (see below). Strongholds are affected by shooting like any other WE, but in addition weapons with the Ignore Cover or BP type weapons (that uses templates) may use AP instead of AT when rolling to hit.
</p>
<h6>Strongholds and Assaults</h6>
<p>
    During assaults, engaging units can either stay outside of the defended Stronghold and attack it with firefight, or they can attempt to clear the Stronghold with hand-to-hand combat. Units using FF may only direct their attacks against the Stronghold, while units using CC may choose between attacking the Stronghold or invading the Stronghold, attacking the units inside directly. In order to be able to invade a Stronghold, a unit must be able to enter it (e.g. INF, or LV / AV with the 'Nimble' special rule). There does not need to be space inside the Stronghold for invading units to enter, but no more units may invade than the Stronghold's number of DC.
</p>
<p>
    Defending units inside the Stronghold counts as having a 3+ Cover Save against CC attacks coming from invading units, which can only hit units that are inside the Stronghold. Defending units inside a Stronghold primarily use their FF stats, but may use CC attacks against enemy units that have entered the Stronghold. Each invading unit forces the defending formation to allocate at least one defending unit, and a maximum of two, for each invading unit which must use CC attacks to fight. These CC attacks can only hit invading units.
</p>
<p>
    Unless the Stronghold has been completely surrounded (with attacking units having two units in base contact for each of the Stronghold's DC), or there are enough units invading the Stronghold to tie up all defending units in CC, defending units may counter charge out of the Stronghold to attack units outside. The Stronghold will be considered as part of the formation for damage inflicted even if all defending units exit it, but will not be considered part of the formation for outnumber if there are no defending units inside it at the end of the assault.
</p>
<p>
    If an attacking formation wishes to avoid damaging the Stronghold, they may refrain from using their CC or FF attacks. If the Stronghold goes down to 0 DC during the Assault it is 'Ruined' (see below). Strongholds only count for Outnumber during an Assault if there is at least one unit inside that is participating in the combat.
</p>

<h6>Ruining Strongholds</h6>
<p>
    Once a Stronghold goes down to 0 DC, it counts as being Ruined, and will be considered to be a smoking, flaming ruin, making it Impassable Terrain with the 'Towering' special rule for the rest of the game. All units inside takes a hit with a +1 armour save modifier (with all damage counted towards Combat Resolution if the Stronghold is Ruined during an assault). Any surviving units are forced to exit the building after the current action has been resolved, being placed within 5 cm. Any formation with at least one unit inside a Ruined Stronghold loses their chance to activate this turn if they have not already done so. If the formation is on Overwatch, they instead count as having taken an 'Hold' action.
</p>

<h4>Line of Sight</h4>

<p>
    Line of Sight in EA - Heresy is played by drawing a line from units' bases (or model if there is no base) to that of the base (or model if no base) of the target. If this line crosses terrain that blocks line of sight, it either stops completely, or can penetrate into (but not through) Area Terrain up to 10 cm. 
<p>
    No ground unit can see directly through a piece of terrain – unless they are in it. Popped up skimmers, Support Craft, and units with the 'Towering' special rule can see and be seen over terrain without the 'Towering' special rule, but can only see units that are further away from the edge of the terrain piece than they are. Same rule as for popped up skimmers also apply for units on hills. Aircraft can always see over and through all terrain.
</p>

<h4>Terrain Effects</h4>
<p>
    We have revised a few of the terrain effects from the NetEA rules. Terrain effects not mentioned here are identical
    to the NetEA rules.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Difficult terrain</b>:
    In addition to the standard Dangerous terrain we have introduced Difficult terrain.

    Roll a D6 when you enter difficult terrain, or when you start to move if already in difficult terrain. On a roll of
    1 you roll a second die. On a roll of 1-3 on the second die, the unit takes a hit with no save allowed, but the
    formation it is part of does not receive a Blast marker.

    Units may choose to move through difficult terrain cautiously. Such a unit counts as having a
    speed of 5 cm, but does not have to roll any Difficult Terrain test. Units with the <i>Walker</i> special rule may
    move through Difficult terrain without rolling Difficult terrain tests.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Open Ground</b>:
    In the Core rules it is mentioned as a terrain effect on open ground that Infantry count as being in cover (-1 to
    hit modifier) and receive a 5+ cover save if they are on <i>Overwatch</i> in Open Ground. We suggest you extend
    this rule to all terrain types. I.e. an Infantry unit on <i>Overwatch</i> in Scrubs (6+ cover save) would still
    get 5+ cover save from being on <i>Overwatch</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hills</b>: As previously mentioned, units on a hill counts as popped up skimmers for the purpose of Line of
    Sight (see the top section of this page). Hills may optionally have one or more steep hillsides, which are
    impassable to all unit types (make sure to cover this during the five minute warm up). If a hill has a terrain feature on top of it that blocks Line of Sight, the combination of the two are considered to have the 'Towering' special rule.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Roads</b>: Units that spend a whole move on a road may add 5 cm to their move (does not apply to non-standard
    movement such as counter charges or consolidation movement). In addition, if all units in the formation are on
    a road at the start of their action, you may declare they will make a road move. If the formation selects an
    Advance, Double or March action they get +1 to the activation roll. However, all the units in the formation must
    remain on the road during the entire action.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Armoured Vehicles</b>:
    Infantry units counts as being in cover and receive the -1 to hit modifier (but no cover save) if they are touching
    a <b>friendly</b> Armoured Vehicle or War Engine (but not a Stronghold), to represent their ability to take cover from enemy fire by
    crouching behind the vehicle. There can be no more than two units for each Armoured Vehicle, or
    two for each DC that a War Engine has.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Hull Down</b>: All terrain that blocks Line of Sight can give Hull Down to units that are inside such terrain, or
    that is even partially obscured behind it, to all units in the firing formation. Support Craft, and units with the 'Towering' special rule, may never claim 'Hull Down' from area terrain, but may only claim it when behind terrain that have the 'Towering' special rule.
